## Projects
<i class="fa fa-codepen"></i><a href ="http://codepen.io/anoonan3805/pen/VjaxjZ">Change Calculator</a><br>
<p>The goal for this project was to create a calculator that takes a total amount owed and total amount given and tells you how much change is owed in quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.</p>

<i class="fa fa-leaf"></i><a href ="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-orbiting-challenge-30/5508486001">Orbiting Challenge 3.0</a><br>
<p>The goal for this project was to make a solar system using Javascript. The project requirements were to add a sun,
three planets of different colors and sizes that orbit the sun (without colliding into each other or the sun) and have
one of the planets orbit in an elipse shape rather than circular.</p>
<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i><a href ="https://tktest-anoonan3805.c9users.io/#/">TK Test App</a><br>
<p>This was the first application I made as a student at Softstack Factory. The TK Test (or Thomas-Kilmann Instrunment) 
is a self-scoring assessment that takes about fifteen minutes to complete. It allows you to discover whether you might 
be overusing (high score) or underusing (low score) one or more of these five conflict-handling modes.</p>
